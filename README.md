# CEC2013python
for testing metaheuristic algorithm which is specific
for continuous search spaces, like Particle Swarm optimizations, Differential evolutions, etc,
one can be sure about the performances of algorithm by testing them in this benchmark. 
Benchmark has been defined by IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence in C++. then developers implemented them in MATLAB and R.
Now I have implemented them in Python as these language getting hit between data scientists a lot. I hope you find it useful.
